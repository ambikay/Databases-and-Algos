1. Suppose you are given a relation R with four attributes ABCD. For each of the following sets of FDs, assuming those are the only dependencies that hold for R, do the following:

i) Identify the candidate key(s) for R
ii) Identify the best normal form that R satisfies
iii) If R is not in BCNF, decompose it into a set of BCNF relations

a) C-->D, C-->A, B-->C
b) B-->C, D-->A
c) ABC-->D, D-->A
d) AB-->C, AB-->D, C-->A, D-->B

2. Consider the attribute set R=ABCDEFGH and the FD set F={AB-->C, AC-->B, AD-->E, B-->D, BC-->A, E-->G}

For each one of the following sets of attributes:

i) Compute the set of functional dependencies that hold over that set
ii) Compute a minimal cover

a) ABC,     b) ABCD,    c) ABCEG,     d) DCEGH,    e) ACEH

3. Suppose that we have the following four tuples in a relation S with three attributes ABC: (1,2,3), (4,2,3), (5,3,3), (5,3,4). Which of the following functional (-->) and multivalued  (-->>) dependencies can you infer does not hold over relation S?

a) A-->B
b) A-->>B
c) BC-->A
d) BC-->>A
e) B->C
f) B-->>C

4. Consider the university enrollment database schema:

Student(snum: integer, sname:string, major:string, level:string, age:integer)
Class(name:string, meets_at:time, room:string, fid:integer)
Enrolled(snum:integer, cname:string)
Faculty(fid:integer, fname:string, deptid:integer)

For each of the following transactions, state the SQL isolation level you would use and explain why you chose it.

a) Enroll a student (snum) into the class named 'Analysis of Algorithms'
b) Change enrollment for a student (snum) from one class to another class
c) Assign a new faculty member (fid)  to the class with the least number of students.
d) For each class, show the number of students enrolled in the class.
